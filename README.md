# HealthKit-and-Bluetooth-App
An Xcode 9 project written in Swift 4 to write data to and read data from the HealthKit framework. Some data is collected using Core Bluetooth.

The global medical device market reached almost $400 BILLION in 2017. Thereâ€™s a lot of money out there for developers who have experience in Apple's `HealthKit` and `Core Bluetooth` frameworks. In the [tutorial corresponding to this app](http://iosbrain.com/blog/2018/05/03/introduction-to-ios-healthkit-with-core-bluetooth-using-swift-4/), I explain the economic opportunities of the smartphone and wearable device markets, discuss the necessity for keeping personal health data private, show you how to configure an app to use HealthKit, and show you how to read data from and write data to the `HealthKit` data store. I've provided lots of screenshots and Swift 4 code to help you get up and running with `HealthKit` and `Core Bluetooth`.

Here's a screenshot from the app that this project builds:
